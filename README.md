# jheadtoubis
Adapter mount for a JHead to the UBIS mount (1.75mm).

Found myself with an Ubis hotend but the printer I wanted to use it with only
had a mount for jheads. Adapters away!

##Usage
Print 2 of one of the STLs. Assemble it around the Ubis hotend, and
then put the assembly where a Jhead is expected. If you need to adjust it for
clearance, the SCADs are available for editing.
